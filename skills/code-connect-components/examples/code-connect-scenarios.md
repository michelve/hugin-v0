# Code Connect Scenarios

## Example 1: Connecting a Button Component

User says: "Connect this Figma button to my code: https://figma.com/design/kL9xQn2VwM8pYrTb4ZcHjF/DesignSystem?node-id=42-15"

**Actions:**

1. Parse URL: fileKey=`kL9xQn2VwM8pYrTb4ZcHjF`, nodeId=`42-15` → convert to `42:15`
2. Run `get_code_connect_suggestions(fileKey="kL9xQn2VwM8pYrTb4ZcHjF", nodeId="42:15")`
3. Response shows: Button component (unmapped) with `variant` (primary/secondary) and `size` (sm/md/lg) properties, plus a thumbnail image
4. Search codebase for Button components: Find `src/components/Button.tsx`
5. Read `Button.tsx` and confirm it has `variant` and `size` props
6. Present to user: "I found a match:
    - [Button](src/components/Button.tsx): Button at nodeId [42:15](https://figma.com/design/kL9xQn2VwM8pYrTb4ZcHjF/DesignSystem?node-id=42-15)

    Would you like to connect this component?"

7. User confirms: "Yes"
8. Detect that it's a TypeScript React component
9. Run `send_code_connect_mappings(fileKey="kL9xQn2VwM8pYrTb4ZcHjF", nodeId="42:15", mappings=[{ nodeId: "42:15", componentName: "Button", source: "src/components/Button.tsx", label: "React" }])`

**Result:** Figma button component is now connected to the code Button component.

## Example 2: Multiple Components with Partial Selection

User says: "Connect components in this frame: https://figma.com/design/pR8mNv5KqXzGwY2JtCfL4D/Components?node-id=10-50"

**Actions:**

1. Parse URL: fileKey=`pR8mNv5KqXzGwY2JtCfL4D`, nodeId=`10-50` → convert to `10:50`
2. Run `get_code_connect_suggestions(fileKey="pR8mNv5KqXzGwY2JtCfL4D", nodeId="10:50")`
3. Response shows 3 unmapped components: ProductCard, Badge, and CustomWidget
4. Search codebase:
    - ProductCard: Found `src/components/ProductCard.tsx` (props match)
    - Badge: Found `src/components/Badge.tsx` (props match)
    - CustomWidget: No matching component found
5. Present to user:
   "The following components match the design:
    - [ProductCard](src/components/ProductCard.tsx): ProductCard at nodeId [10:51](https://figma.com/design/pR8mNv5KqXzGwY2JtCfL4D/Components?node-id=10-51)
    - [Badge](src/components/Badge.tsx): Badge at nodeId [10:52](https://figma.com/design/pR8mNv5KqXzGwY2JtCfL4D/Components?node-id=10-52)

    I couldn't find a match for CustomWidget (10:53).

    Would you like to connect these components? You can accept all, select specific ones, or skip."

6. User: "Just connect ProductCard, skip Badge for now"
7. Run `send_code_connect_mappings(fileKey="pR8mNv5KqXzGwY2JtCfL4D", nodeId="10:50", mappings=[{ nodeId: "10:51", componentName: "ProductCard", source: "src/components/ProductCard.tsx", label: "React" }])`

**Result:** Only ProductCard is connected, per the user's selection.

## Example 3: Component Needs Creation

User says: "Connect this icon: https://figma.com/design/8yJDMeWDyBz71EnMOSuUiw/Icons?node-id=5-20"

**Actions:**

1. Parse URL: fileKey=`8yJDMeWDyBz71EnMOSuUiw`, nodeId=`5-20` → convert to `5:20`
2. Run `get_code_connect_suggestions(fileKey="8yJDMeWDyBz71EnMOSuUiw", nodeId="5:20")`
3. Response shows: CheckIcon component (unmapped) with color and size properties
4. Search codebase for CheckIcon: No matches found
5. Search for generic Icon components: Find `src/icons/` directory with other icons
6. Report to user: "I couldn't find a CheckIcon component, but I found an icons directory at src/icons/. Would you like to:
    - Create a new CheckIcon.tsx component first, then connect it
    - Connect to a different existing icon
    - Provide the path to the CheckIcon if it exists elsewhere"
7. User provides path: "src/icons/CheckIcon.tsx"
8. Detect language and framework from the file
9. Run `send_code_connect_mappings(fileKey="8yJDMeWDyBz71EnMOSuUiw", nodeId="5:20", mappings=[{ nodeId: "5:20", componentName: "CheckIcon", source: "src/icons/CheckIcon.tsx", label: "React" }])`

**Result:** CheckIcon component is successfully connected to the Figma design.
