# Best Practices

## Start Simple, Iterate

Don't try to capture every rule upfront. Start with the most important conventions and add rules as you encounter inconsistencies.

## Be Specific

Instead of: "Use the design system"
Write: "Always use Button components from `src/components/ui/Button.tsx` with variant prop ('primary' | 'secondary' | 'ghost')"

## Make Rules Actionable

Each rule should tell the agent exactly what to do, not just what to avoid.

Good: "Colors are defined in `src/theme/colors.ts` - import and use these constants"
Bad: "Don't hardcode colors"

## Use IMPORTANT for Critical Rules

Prefix rules that must never be violated with "IMPORTANT:" to ensure the agent prioritizes them.

```markdown
- IMPORTANT: Never expose API keys in client-side code
- IMPORTANT: Always sanitize user input before rendering
```

## Document the Why

When rules seem arbitrary, explain the reasoning:

```markdown
- Place all data-fetching in server components (reduces client bundle size and improves performance)
- Use absolute imports with `@/` alias (makes refactoring easier and prevents broken relative paths)
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: The agent isn't following the rules

**Cause:** Rules may be too vague or not properly loaded by the agent.
**Solution:**

- Make rules more specific and actionable
- Verify rules are saved in the correct configuration file
- Restart your agent or IDE to reload rules
- Add "IMPORTANT:" prefix to critical rules

### Issue: Rules conflict with each other

**Cause:** Contradictory or overlapping rules.
**Solution:**

- Review all rules for conflicts
- Establish a clear priority hierarchy
- Remove redundant rules
- Consolidate related rules into single, clear statements

### Issue: Too many rules increase latency

**Cause:** Excessive rules increase context size and processing time.
**Solution:**

- Focus on the 20% of rules that solve 80% of consistency issues
- Remove overly specific rules that rarely apply
- Combine related rules
- Use progressive disclosure (basic rules first, advanced rules in linked files)

### Issue: Rules become outdated as project evolves

**Cause:** Codebase changes but rules don't.
**Solution:**

- Schedule periodic rule reviews (monthly or quarterly)
- Update rules when architectural decisions change
- Version control your rule files
- Document rule changes in commit messages

## Understanding Design System Rules

Design system rules transform how AI coding agents work with your Figma designs:

**Before rules:**

- The agent makes assumptions about component structure
- Inconsistent styling approaches across implementations
- Hardcoded values that don't match design tokens
- Components created in random locations
- Repetitive explanations of project conventions

**After rules:**

- The agent automatically follows your conventions
- Consistent component structure and styling
- Proper use of design tokens from the start
- Components organized correctly
- Zero repetitive prompting

The time invested in creating good rules pays off exponentially across every Figma implementation task.
