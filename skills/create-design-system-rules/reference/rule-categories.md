# Rule Categories and Examples

## Essential Rules (Always Include)

**Component Discovery:**

```markdown
- UI components are located in `src/components/ui/`
- Feature components are in `src/components/features/`
- Layout primitives are in `src/components/layout/`
```

**Design Token Usage:**

```markdown
- Colors are defined as CSS variables in `src/styles/tokens.css`
- Never hardcode hex colors - use `var(--color-*)` tokens
- Spacing uses the 4px base scale: `--space-1` (4px), `--space-2` (8px), etc.
```

**Styling Approach:**

```markdown
- Use Tailwind utility classes for styling
- Custom styles go in component-level CSS modules
- Theme customization is in `tailwind.config.js`
```

## Recommended Rules (Highly Valuable)

**Component Patterns:**

```markdown
- All components must accept a `className` prop for composition
- Variant props should use union types: `variant: 'primary' | 'secondary'`
- Icon components should accept `size` and `color` props
```

**Import Conventions:**

```markdown
- Use path aliases: `@/components`, `@/styles`, `@/utils`
- Group imports: React, third-party, internal, types
- No relative imports beyond parent directory
```

**Code Quality:**

```markdown
- Add JSDoc comments for exported components
- Include PropTypes or TypeScript types for all props
- Extract magic numbers to named constants
```

## Optional Rules (Project-Specific)

**Accessibility:**

```markdown
- All interactive elements must have aria-labels
- Color contrast must meet WCAG AA standards
- Keyboard navigation required for all interactions
```

**Performance:**

```markdown
- Lazy load images with the `Image` component from `@/components/Image`
- Use React.memo for components that receive complex props
- Icons should be SVG components, not icon fonts
```

**Testing:**

```markdown
- Include unit tests for new components in `__tests__/` directory
- Use Testing Library queries (getByRole, getByLabelText)
- Test all interactive states and variants
```
