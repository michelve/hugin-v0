## Current Project Context

```
!`ls e2e/*.spec.ts 2>/dev/null || echo 'No e2e test files found'`
```

## Project Conventions (Draft v0)

This project uses `@playwright/test` with TypeScript. The conventions below **take precedence** over the generic skill patterns.

### Formal Tests (default - use this for real tests)

- **Location**: `e2e/*.spec.ts`
- **Run**: `pnpm test:e2e` (headless) or `pnpm test:e2e:ui` (interactive)
- **Config**: `playwright.config.ts` - `baseURL` is `http://localhost:5173`, `webServer` auto-starts via `pnpm dev`
- **No manual server detection needed** - the config handles it
- **Use relative paths** - `page.goto("/")` not `page.goto("http://localhost:5173/")`
- **TypeScript only** - `.spec.ts` files, named exports, no raw `.js` scripts in the project

**New test template:**

```typescript
// e2e/my-feature.spec.ts
import { expect, test } from "@playwright/test";

test("description of what it checks", async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto("/route");
    await expect(page.locator("h1")).toBeVisible();
});
```

**Existing example:** `e2e/home.spec.ts`

### Ad-hoc Exploration (quick visual checks only)

For rapid one-off checks where you don't need a persistent test, the generic `/tmp` script approach below still works. Use `pnpm test:e2e:ui` first - it's usually faster.

**IMPORTANT - Path Resolution:**
This skill can be installed in different locations (plugin system, manual installation, global, or project-specific). Before executing any commands, determine the skill directory based on where you loaded this SKILL.md file, and use that path in all commands below. Replace `$SKILL_DIR` with the actual discovered path.

Common installation paths:

- Plugin system: `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/playwright-skill/skills/playwright-skill`
- Manual global: `~/.claude/skills/playwright-skill`
- Project-specific: `<project>/.claude/skills/playwright-skill`

# Playwright Browser Automation

General-purpose browser automation skill. I'll write custom Playwright code for any automation task you request and execute it via the universal executor.

**CRITICAL WORKFLOW - Follow these steps in order:**

1. **Auto-detect dev servers** - For localhost testing, ALWAYS run server detection FIRST:

    ```bash
    cd $SKILL_DIR && node -e "require('./lib/helpers').detectDevServers().then(servers => console.log(JSON.stringify(servers)))"
    ```

    - If **1 server found**: Use it automatically, inform user
    - If **multiple servers found**: Ask user which one to test
    - If **no servers found**: Ask for URL or offer to help start dev server

2. **Write scripts to /tmp** - NEVER write test files to skill directory; always use `/tmp/playwright-test-*.js`

3. **Use visible browser by default** - Always use `headless: false` unless user specifically requests headless mode

4. **Parameterize URLs** - Always make URLs configurable via environment variable or constant at top of script

## How It Works

1. You describe what you want to test/automate
2. I auto-detect running dev servers (or ask for URL if testing external site)
3. I write custom Playwright code in `/tmp/playwright-test-*.js` (won't clutter your project)
4. I execute it via: `cd $SKILL_DIR && node run.js /tmp/playwright-test-*.js`
5. Results displayed in real-time, browser window visible for debugging
6. Test files auto-cleaned from /tmp by your OS

## Setup (First Time)

```bash
cd $SKILL_DIR
npm run setup
```

This installs Playwright and Chromium browser. Only needed once.

## Execution Pattern

See [examples/execution-patterns.md](examples/execution-patterns.md) for the 3-step execution workflow (detect dev servers, write test script to /tmp, execute from skill directory).

## Common Patterns

See [examples/common-patterns.md](examples/common-patterns.md) for 6 ready-to-use patterns: responsive testing, login flow, form submission, broken link checking, screenshot with error handling, and responsive design testing.

## Inline Execution (Simple Tasks)

For quick one-off tasks, you can execute code inline without creating files:

```bash
# Take a quick screenshot
cd $SKILL_DIR && node run.js "
const browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: false });
const page = await browser.newPage();
await page.goto('http://localhost:3001');
await page.screenshot({ path: '/tmp/quick-screenshot.png', fullPage: true });
console.log('Screenshot saved');
await browser.close();
"
```

**When to use inline vs files:**

- **Inline**: Quick one-off tasks (screenshot, check if element exists, get page title)
- **Files**: Complex tests, responsive design checks, anything user might want to re-run

## Available Helpers & Custom HTTP Headers

See [reference/helpers-headers-guide.md](reference/helpers-headers-guide.md) for helper function reference (detectDevServers, safeClick, safeType, takeScreenshot, handleCookieBanner, extractTableData) and custom HTTP header configuration.

## Advanced Usage

- Authentication & session management
- Visual regression testing
- Mobile device emulation
- Performance testing
- Debugging techniques
- CI/CD integration

## Tips

- **CRITICAL: Detect servers FIRST** - Always run `detectDevServers()` before writing test code for localhost testing
- **Custom headers** - Use `PW_HEADER_NAME`/`PW_HEADER_VALUE` env vars to identify automated traffic to your backend
- **Use /tmp for test files** - Write to `/tmp/playwright-test-*.js`, never to skill directory or user's project
- **Parameterize URLs** - Put detected/provided URL in a `TARGET_URL` constant at the top of every script
- **DEFAULT: Visible browser** - Always use `headless: false` unless user explicitly asks for headless mode
- **Headless mode** - Only use `headless: true` when user specifically requests "headless" or "background" execution
- **Slow down:** Use `slowMo: 100` to make actions visible and easier to follow
- **Wait strategies:** Use `waitForURL`, `waitForSelector`, `waitForLoadState` instead of fixed timeouts
- **Error handling:** Always use try-catch for robust automation
- **Console output:** Use `console.log()` to track progress and show what's happening

## Troubleshooting

**Playwright not installed:**

```bash
cd $SKILL_DIR && npm run setup
```

**Module not found:**
Ensure running from skill directory via `run.js` wrapper

**Browser doesn't open:**
Check `headless: false` and ensure display available

**Element not found:**
Add wait: `await page.waitForSelector('.element', { timeout: 10000 })`

## Example Usage

```
User: "Test if the marketing page looks good"

Claude: I'll test the marketing page across multiple viewports. Let me first detect running servers...
[Runs: detectDevServers()]
[Output: Found server on port 3001]
I found your dev server running on http://localhost:3001

[Writes custom automation script to /tmp/playwright-test-marketing.js with URL parameterized]
[Runs: cd $SKILL_DIR && node run.js /tmp/playwright-test-marketing.js]
[Shows results with screenshots from /tmp/]
```

```
User: "Check if login redirects correctly"

Claude: I'll test the login flow. First, let me check for running servers...
[Runs: detectDevServers()]
[Output: Found servers on ports 3000 and 3001]
I found 2 dev servers. Which one should I test?
- http://localhost:3000
- http://localhost:3001

User: "Use 3001"

[Writes login automation to /tmp/playwright-test-login.js]
[Runs: cd $SKILL_DIR && node run.js /tmp/playwright-test-login.js]
[Reports: ✅ Login successful, redirected to /dashboard]
```

## Notes

- Each automation is custom-written for your specific request
- Not limited to pre-built scripts - any browser task possible
- Auto-detects running dev servers to eliminate hardcoded URLs
- Test scripts written to `/tmp` for automatic cleanup (no clutter)
- Code executes reliably with proper module resolution via `run.js`
- Progressive disclosure - API_REFERENCE.md loaded only when advanced features needed
